         it from Lagos Metropolitan Area, is a state in the southwestern geopolitical zone of Nigeria. 
        The smallest in area of Nigeria's 36 states,Lagos State is arguably the most economically important
        state of the country,containing Lagos, the nation's largest urban area. It is a major financial 
        centre and would be the fifth largest economy in Africa, if it were a country.It has the highest population density
        of Nigeria's states. The actual population total is disputed between the official Nigerian Census of 2006 
        and a much higher figure claimed by the Lagos State Government.

        history: `Oyo, state, western Nigeria. Oyo was reduced in size when Osun
         state was created out of its eastern portion in 1991. Oyo is bounded by the states of 
         Kwara on the north, Osun on the east, and Ogun on the south and by the Republic of Benin on the west. 
         Oyo state is traversed by the Yoruba Hills in the north. The state has some tropical rain forest in the south
          around Ibadan, the state capital, but is covered mostly by a “derived” savanna that is largely the result of 
          clearing and burning the former forest cover to provide land for cultivation. The Ogun is the most important river. 
          Oyo state is inhabited mainly by the Yoruba people.
  
        The economy of Oyo is based chiefly on agriculture and handicrafts.`,

        history: `Abuja, city, capital of Nigeria. It lies in the central part of Nigeria, in the Federal
           Capital Territory (FCT; created 1976). The city is approximately 300 miles (480 km) northeast of Lagos, 
           the former capital (until 1991). 
          During the 1980s the new capital city was built and developed on the grass-covered Chukuku Hills.
          The site was chosen for Nigeria’s new capital because of its central location, easy accessibility, 
          salubrious climate, and low population density and the availability of land for future expansion. 
          It was the first planned city to be built in Nigeria. Abuja lies at 1,180 feet (360 metres) 
          above sea level and has a cooler climate and less humidity than is found in Lagos.

        history: `Abia, state, east-central Nigeria. Abia was administratively created in 1991 from the eastern half of former Imo state. It is bordered by the states of Enugu and Ebonyi to the north, Akwa Ibom to the east and southeast, Rivers to the south and southwest, and Imo and Anambra to the west. Abia includes areas of oil-palm bush and tropical rain forest in its southern part and woodland savanna in its hilly north. Most of the population is engaged in agriculture; yams, taro, corn (maize), rice, and cassava are the staple crops, and oil palm is the main cash crop. Mineral resources include lead and zinc.
  
          The state’s chief industrial centre is Aba, which lies on the railway north from Port Harcourt and manufactures textiles, 
          pharmaceuticals, soap, plastics, cement, footware, and cosmetics. Umuahia, the state capital, has a palm-oil–processing 
          plant and several breweries. Abia state is mainly inhabited by the Igbo (Ibo) people and is one of the most densely 
          populated areas in Nigeria. The main highway network serves Umuahia and Aba. Pop. (2006) 2,833,999.`,

           miles (148 km) east of Ibadan. An urban and industrial centre of the region, it was founded by the Ekiti people,

          a long-standing tradition of cotton weaving. The town also produces shoes and pottery and 
          is a collecting point for commercial crops such as cocoa and timber. Crops such as yams,

          Enugu is on the railroad from Port Harcourt, 150 miles (240 km) south-southwest, and at the intersection of roads from Aba,
           Onitsha, and Abakaliki. The town owes its existence to the discovery of coal on the plateau in 1909, 
           which led to the building of Port Harcourt. With the completion of the railway from the port in 1916,
          Enugu developed rapidly. Its name comes from the traditional Igbo (Ibo) words enu Ugwu, meaning “at the top of the hill.”
          The headquarters (1939–51) of the Eastern provinces and the regional capital (1951–67) of Eastern Nigeria, Enugu served briefly (May–October 1967) as the provisional capital of the secessionist Republic of Biafra (1967–70) until its capture by federal troops.
